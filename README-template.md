## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- javascript
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned


I got to learn how to use grid, flexbox and when to make use of padding and margin, learnt about some new html tags, i learnt how to use github, netlify to host my project, and i now i know about hashnode. this task opened me to a lot of new things.

Here are some new tags i got to know about:

```html
<small>this makes the text smaller</small>
<main>instead of having a div tag  and giving it a class of miain,just use main tag</main>
```

### Continued development


I would love to focus on css animation, during this project i noticed some animation properties while working and i want to learn more about it
