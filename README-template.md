## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- javascript


### What I learned


I got to learn how to use grid, flexbox and when to make use of padding and margin, learnt about some new html tags, i learnt how to use github, netlify to host my project, and i now i know about hashnode. this task opened me to a lot of new things.

Here are some new tags i got to know about:

```html
<small>this makes the text smaller</small>
<main>instead of having a div tag  and giving it a class of miain,just use main tag</main>
```

### Continued development


I would love to focus on css animation, during this project i noticed some animation properties while working and i want to learn more about it
